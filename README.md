# AlgorithmChallenges

Challenge Container Load:
* For a given collection of container sizes and a required load, write an algorithm
(simple console app will suffice), that will select sufficient containers for
the load, such that:
	* The overcapacity is minimized, and
	* The smallest number of containers are used
* How run the program:
	* python3 container_load.py (Note main block invokes unittest case execution)
